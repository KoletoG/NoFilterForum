Make a separate Domain folder and create models with encapsulation
Use paralellism
Try fixing warnings wherever needed
Use is instead of == for null checks
Use records for DTOs
Change to init for models wherever suitable or private set or whatever haha
In postService for example, make the code follow DRY
KISS principle need to follow
SOLID wherever i can
A lot of the request models could be simplified
Might add Application proj
Use () syntax
Use nameof()
//
Logger.IsEnabled() to not allocate memory when debug logging
